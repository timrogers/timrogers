# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tim, and I'm a product leader and polygot software engineer based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

I work as a Product Manager at GitHub, looking after migration tools. We're building tools to make it easy and stress-free for customers to move between GitHub products and from competitors to GitHub.

In my spare time, I love to code, whether that's on my own [private projects](https://rewardnights.com) or open-source projects. I'm the maintainer of [Restforce](https://github.com/restforce/restforce), the most popular Ruby ðŸ’Ž library for working with the Salesforce API.
