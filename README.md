# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tim, and I'm a product leader and polygot software engineer based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

I work as a Product Manager at GitHub, looking after:

* the [REST](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and [GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) APIs for talking to GitHub
* [webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks) so GitHub can talk to you
* [libraries](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/libraries) - sometimes called "SDKs" - which help you build smarter on our platform

In my spare time, I love to code, whether that's on my own [private projects](https://rewardnights.com) or open-source projects. I'm the maintainer of [Restforce](https://github.com/restforce/restforce), the most popular Ruby ðŸ’Ž library for working with the Salesforce API.
