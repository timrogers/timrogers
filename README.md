# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tim, and I'm a product leader and polyglot software engineer based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

Today, I'm a Product Manager at GitHub working on Copilot. We're building a conversational, personalised assistant to make developers happier and more producitve.

In my spare time, I love to code, whether that's on my building [cool products](https://foreigncurrencysavings.co.uk/) or hacking on open-source projects.

I'm the maintainer of [Restforce](https://github.com/restforce/restforce), the most popular Ruby ðŸ’Ž library for working with the Salesforce API, and [`obsidian-share-as-gist`](https://github.com/timrogers/obsidian-share-as-gist), an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) extension for sharing your notes as GitHub Gists.
